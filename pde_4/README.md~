## Partial differential equation

### Introduction

When have an equation which relations multivariable functions and their partial
derivates, we have a partial differential euqations.

Partial differential equations are using in a lot of phenomenas such as sound,
head, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, etc.

### Classification

In case of second-order partial differential equations, we can classified them
as parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic.


### Goal

This repository is used to solve partial differential equations by finite
element method or finite difference method.
